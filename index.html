         </div>

         <p>
            Ultimate is a self-officiated, non-contact team sport played with a disc.<br><br>
            Strategically like soccer, athletically like basketball, technically like football, but
            spiritually like no other sport, ultimate pushes players to their limits in often brutal competition for the disc.<br><br>
            To learn more about ultimate's rules and lingo, see our
            <a href="ultimate101.html">dictionary</a>
            as well as

            <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
         </div>

         <p>
            <b>When did this Ultimate madness start at RPI?</b><br><br>
            We've been there since the beginning, RPI lost to Rutgers University in the finals of the first ever UPA Championship Ultimate Tournament which took place at Yale in 1975.
         </p>

         <p>
            <b>What does TRUDGE mean?</b><br><br>
            Yes, the infamous question with a really bad answer. Back in the day, there were 10 college males on the team (or at least a couple girls that also considered themselves 'dudes').
            Pursuing revenge on the 1975 game vs. Rutgers (see above), these self-proclamed uglies decided they needed a new name. Hence: Ten Really Ugly Dudes Getting Even, or TRUDGE.
